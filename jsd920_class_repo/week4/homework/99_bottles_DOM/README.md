# 99 Bottles of Beer - DOM Version

Remember the 99 Bottles of Beer assignment? For this assignment, you'll be creating a website that programatically displays the lyrics to that song.

1. You'll need to create both an .html file and a .js file (be sure to link them!)
2. If you plan on using jQuery, properly link to an external CDN
3. In your HTML file, you'll want to have an unordered list (<ul>) that will contain all of your lyrics
4. Each line of the song should appear inside of a list item (<li>) within that unordered list
5. Your JavaScript file should programatically append each line of the song to the page--no hard-coding lyrics in HTML!
