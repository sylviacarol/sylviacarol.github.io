Making a favorites list: jQuery

You'll add the ability to complete tasks in your favorite things list. Your program must complete the following rules:

- Using jQuery, add a "complete task" link at the end of each to-do item (i.e. each "favorite thing").
- When clicked, the link will cross out the current item (hint: add a class to the list that sets the text-decoration to line-through).
- Each new item added by the user needs to also have the "complete task" link at the end.
