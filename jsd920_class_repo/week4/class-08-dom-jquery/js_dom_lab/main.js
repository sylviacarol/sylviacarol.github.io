Making a favorites list: DOM manipulation


- When the user clicks the submit button, take the value they've typed
  into the input box and add it to the list (hint: appendChild)

- Also, when a new item is added to the list, clear the input box.

*/

function addToList(list, newThing) {

}

window.onload = function() {
  // YOUR CODE HERE!

};

/*

Bonus:

When they click submit without typing anything, alert the user
"you must type in a value!"
  (Hint: the `value` property of the input box, before anyone types in it,
  is the empty string.)
