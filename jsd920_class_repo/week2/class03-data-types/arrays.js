 * Create an array of image source filenames.

/**
 * Question 4
 * Using the array from Question 1, store the last element of the array

// Bonus 1
// Using the array from Question 1, capitalize the first letter of each 
// element in the array and store the elments in a new variable bonus1.
// The a final array should look like:  ["Image1.png", "Image2.png", and "Image3.png]
// HINTS:
// -using the .split("") method will covert a string of text into an array
// -using the .join("") method wil join the elements back into a string
// -using .toUpperCase() will covert a letter from lower to upper case

// Your code here
//Perform the same action for each item in the array

/**
 * Question 5
 * Create an array of numbers using 1, 2, 3, and 4 as values.
 * Use a for loop, .forEach() or .map() method to increase
 * each value by 1. You can either store each new value back in the original
 * array, or in a new array -- your choice. The end result should be
 * an array of numbers with values 2, 3, 4, and 5.

 /** - BONUS 2
  * Using the array of ["a","b","c","a","b"], create a new array which contains 
 * only unique values from the array provided. Store the new array in bonus2.
 * HINTS: 
 * - the .filter() method can be used to return comparisons that evaluate to true
 * - the .reduce() method can also be used to return true evaluations and also create a new array
 * - the .indexOf() method can be used to find the first matching value of an element in an array

  * Using the array of [1,2,3,1,2], determine if any one value is the sum of the values

  * HINTS: 
  * - a for() loop can be used to iterate through each element in array
  * - the .slice() method can be used to disect an array
  * - the .reduce() method can be used to sum all the values in an array
